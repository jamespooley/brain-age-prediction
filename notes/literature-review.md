## The importance of brain developmental trajectories

![Examples of Neurodevelopmental Trajectories](trajectories.jpg)

* Many psychiatric conditions now viewed as neurodevelopmental disorders.
* The promise of mental "growth charts" is personalized "interventions at
  the developmental trajectory itself, rather than at cross-sectional symptoms." Focusing on the trajectory rather than the symptoms is important since clinical signs and symptoms often appear "relatively late in the disease process."
* "cross-sectional and longitudinal effects in neuro-anatomical measurements are relatively small, making them easily obscured by distortions arising from patient and subject movement. In addition to lowering sensitivity, motion can also introduce systematic bias into statistical comparisons, since groups are commonly defined according to behavioral, clinical, and developmental variables that relate to differing levels of movement during data collection" [[source]](http://lcn.salk.edu/publications/Revelant%20Publications/Brown%20-%20Prospective%20motion%20correction%202010.pdf)
* Obtaining and working with longitudinal datasets involving neonatal, infant, pediatric, and
  adolescent populations is challenging, and even more so when dealing with
  subpopulations with psychiatric conditions.
* Head movement and MRI. Use ADHD as example.

> Mental illnesses are disorders of life trajectories beginning before birth and extending into older age. Longitudinal trajectory-based studies of the origins of mental illness during early development are the key to better diagnostic 
and treatment tools for mentally ill patients. Had researchers taken a cross-
sectional approach, they might
 not have found the important 
link between genetic variation, clinical outcome, and cortical
 thickness in ADHD presented 
in Section I. Variation between individuals 
can mask detection of subtle, but potentially 
important developmental shifts within individuals over time. While cross group 
comparisons at set time points can address mechanisms 
of development, they detect 
developmental dynamics that may be critical but
 variable across individuals. Longitudinal 
studies involve examining changes in behavior and brain processes over a developmental 
course within individuals, and can identify 
change within a developmental process or 
clinical symptom and link it to genetic de
terminants and neural correlates. Looking 
longitudinally, particularly over key transition 
points, may help elucidate the similarities 
and differences between periods
 of development, and determine which periods are more 
vulnerable to disruption. Longitudinal analyses 
could also have important implications in 
therapeutic decisions (e.g., whether a mental illness should be treated similarly in children 
and adults), and could help clinicians devel
op individualized treatment, taking into account 
not only the trajectory of healthy development, but also adapting treatments to a patient's 
individual circumstances. Finally, longitudinal studies of high-risk individuals that do not 
develop psychopathology may be valuable in elucidating protective factors, and serve as the 
basis for developing novel therapeutics. 
>
> Ultimately, the goal of research in this ne
w field is to prevent mental illness from 
developing and, barring that, to have early and 
effective intervention strategies that are 
adaptable for each patient. One way to approach 
this goal is to target interventions at the 
developmental trajectory itself, rather than at
 cross-sectional symptoms. Identification of 
deviations from typical trajectories in neurochemical development (e.g., serotonergic 
transmission in autism) may provide a basis 
for interventions targeted toward specific 
developmental periods. The great promise is
 that interventions will guide altered 
developmental trajectories back to a more typi
cal path, diminishing treatment needs in later 
life. 
The results of the NIMH-funded North Amer
ican Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) 
highlight the potential of clinical epidemiology in predicting which youth are more or less 
likely to develop schizophrenia (Addington, et
 al., 2007). Youth who 
are going to develop 
psychosis can be identified before their illness becomes full-blown 35 percent of the time, if 
they meet widely accepted criteria for risk. Th
e NAPLS study shows that this figure rises to 
between 65 and 80 percent if youth have certain combinations of risk factors: deteriorating 
social functioning; family history of psychosis 
paired with recent decline in ability to 
function; increase in unusual thoughts; increase in suspicion/paranoia; and, past or current 
drug abuse. Knowing what these risk factors 
are—particularly combin
ations of them—can 
help scientists predict who is likely to devel
op the illnesses within two to three years with 
the same accuracy that other kinds of risk fa
ctors can predict major medical diseases, such 
as diabetes. This type of work will be critical to early identification, and possible 
prevention or early intervention in at-risk individuals with complex mental illness.

> Diffusion MRI is very sensitive to motion, due to phase shifts induced microscopically by diffusion-driven water molecular displacements, and macroscopically by head motion, cardiac pulsation and breathing. This sensitivity increases with the intensity and duration of gradient pulses, which are characterized by the b-value, the scalar that defines the amount of diffusion weighting in the experiment (Le Bihan et al., 2001). It can be reduced by synchronizing the acquisition with the source of motion, monitoring using “navigator echoes,” using specific protocols, applying real-time prospective motion and outlier detection methods; however, all of these may raise other problems such as increased acquisition times (Ordidge et al., 1994; Pipe, 1999; Kennedy and Zhong, 2004; Zwiers, 2010; Zhou et al., 2011b; Kober et al., 2012; Ling et al., 2012). Even though it is also possible, and even advisable, to correct subject motion using preprocessing techniques (see in preprocessing steps below), the best approach is still to use comfortable padding to adjust the participant's head, and to inform the subject in advance about the noise and the vibration of the bed. This vibration was recently reported as the cause of another artifact, known as vibration artifact. During the acquisition, strong gradients are applied causing low-frequency mechanical resonances of the MR system that lead to small brain tissue movements. When these movements occur in the direction of the diffusion-encoding gradient, phase offsets will occur inducing signal dropouts in DWI images. This kind of artifacts can be reduced increasing TR (with the drawback of reducing SNR) or using full k-space coverage combined with parallel imaging (e.g., GRAPPA) (Gallichan et al., 2010). It can also be compensated using methods such as phase-encoding reversal (COVIPER) (Mohammadi et al., 2012), implemented in Artifact Correction in Diffusion MRI (ACID) toolbox.

### BrainAGE

![The BrainAGE Framework](brainage.png)

BrainAGE is a general, well-validated, kernel regression-based modeling framework that allows researchers to predict a subject's chronological 
age from sMRI data. 

Describe SVR in more detail here? Assume it is known to all?

Given a dataset of whole-brain sMRI data, BrainAGE can be used to assess
neurodevelopment as follows:
* Create train/test split of the whole-brain sMRI data.
* Train SVR on training set.
* Use SVR to predict age of individuals in the test set.
* Calculate BrainAGE Score (= predicted age - chronological age)
* ...
* Profit

## Motion correction strategies

* http://mriquestions.com/reducing-motion-artifacts.html
* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320676/
* If a general overview of the current state of motion correction in rs-fMRI
  studies is needed, [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25462692/)
  overview is probably what to cite.

Two general methods: 
* **Retrospective:** Use information about the subject’s motion to estimate what k-space data would have been measured if the subject had not moved during scanning. 
* **Prospective:** Use motion-tracking data acquired during the scan to follow the subject with the gradient axes of the sequence, measuring the desired k-space data directly. 

### Prospective correction – measure during scan and adjust scanning parameters

Prospective motion correction works by employing pulse sequences that modify
the location of data acquisition at each timepoint.

According to the Poldrack et al. fMRI book:
>"One relatively new development in fMRI methods is the availability of pulse
>sequences that modify the location of the data acquisition at every timepoint
>in order to prospectively correct for head motion. This approach has the
>benefit of creating a motion-corrected dataset without the need for any
>interpolation. The use of prospective motion correction could be quite
>beneficial but it is important for users to consider the robustness of these
>methods for their particular applications. **Since the online methods must use
>quick and thus relatively simple methods for estimating the location of the
>slices for the next timepoint, there could potentially be error in the
>predicted slice location which could, for example, cause loss of data from
>particular brain regions. Because such errors would be more likely in cases of
>large within-scan motion, these methods may paradoxically be best suited to
>populations where the motion is relatively minor."**

Kids with ADHD certainly wouldn't be a population where motion is expected to
be "relatively minor," so maybe this should be explored in a bit more detail.
See if the PROMO papers mention this.

### Retrospective – impossible sMRI (Update: It's possible)

RMC for sMRI involves breaking up the long scan needed for high-resolution
T1-weighted images into a series of shorter scans, each resulting in images
with lower SNR than the image that would be produced by one long scanning
session. These low(er) SNR images are then averaged, resulting in a structural
image with a higher SNR and motion correction. The reference for this procedure is
[here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.20235/abstract).

### Some techniques that try to minimize head motion artifacts during reconstruction

> Additionally, it is possible to combine [prospective and retrospective] methods so that retrospective processing corrects residual errors in the prospective system. A retrospective system can access all of the k-space data while performing reconstruction; a prospective system must necessarily rely only on previous measurements to estimate the current position of the patient. However, a prospective system avoids the need to estimate missing k-space data, allowing for direct reconstruction while avoiding possible sources of estimation error in the k-space data.

### Group level – include as covariate

> In any case, if motion estimates are available, a correlation analysis among motion and other predictors should always be performed and any co-linearity should be reported. High co-linearity between predictors makes it difficult to disentangle their effects and is symptomatic of insufficient information, which cannot be rectified by simple data manipulation. In this case, inclusion of a motion co-variate into the statistical model can shadow any real effects. This is problematic, as in many settings motion can be expected to be correlated with the variable of interest (disease severity, age, drug dose etc.).
> 
> Collecting several structural scans and manually selecting one without motion artifacts for the structural analysis seems to be a commonly used option even in the presence of a costly increase in scan time. This procedure can reduce the spurious motion effect, but does not completely eliminate it. Furthermore, it is difficult in many study groups to obtain even a single scan without visible motion artifacts. While a visual inspection of automatically generated results is always recommended, it is often up to the individual expert to decide whether to exclude or repeat a scan or not. Since even small and visually inconspicuous, yet consistent, motion artifacts might bias the results, we believe that reducing motion during the scan is currently the best option. Controlling for motion in the statistical analysis is a second alternative that ideally should go hand in hand with a correlation analysis between motion and the predictors of interest.

Global signal regression also used. Potential problem in rs-fMRI studies
looking at iFC since global signal could be meaningful. Also, doesn't completely
get rid of problem.
