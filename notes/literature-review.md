# The Promise of "Psychiatric Growth Charts"

* The importance of brain developmental trajectories
* Previous findings with T1, quantitive relaxometry, DTI, DKI, NODDI, rs-fMRI and trajectories – brain age prediction
* Impact of head motion on trajectories
* Motion correction strategies
  1. Prospective correction – measure during scan and adjust scanning parameters
  2. Retrospective – impossible sMRI
  3. Some techniques that try to minimize head motion artifacts during reconstruction
  4. Group level – include as covariate
